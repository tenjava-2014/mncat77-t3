mncat77's ten.java submission
==============================

[![ten.java](https://cdn.mediacru.sh/hu4CJqRD7AiB.svg)](https://tenjava.com/)

This is a submission for the 2014 ten.java contest.

- __Theme:__ What sort of world generation could result in a completely different survival experience?
- __Time:__ Time 3 (7/12/2014 14:00 to 7/13/2014 00:00 UTC)
- __MC Version:__ 1.7.9 (latest Bukkit beta)
- __Stream URL:__ https://twitch.tv/mncat77

<!-- put chosen theme above -->

---------------------------------------

Compilation
-----------

- Download & Install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tenjava/mncat77-t3`
- Compile and create the plugin package using Maven: `mvn`

Maven will download all required dependencies and build a ready-for-use plugin package!

---------------------------------------

Usage
-----

1. Install plugin
2. Set the plugin as the generator for your primary world in the bukkit.yml
3. Start Bukkit and let your world generate
4. Explore! 'Cause that's the whole fun of it (You spawn on a bedrock chunk, the new terrain is everywhere but there, just tp yourself somewhere or walk off; Downsides to using NMS rather than Bukkit API)


This plugin changes up world generation, tweaks spawn rates and adds some structures to your world.
Survival is mainly made harder with this.

Look out for:
 * Dungeons
 * "Clouds"
 * Patches of TNT
 * Whirls in the Desert
 * Rare very powerful mobs as random spawns
 * and more



I really messed up my time schedule and ended up wasting about 5 hours of time D: (started 1 hour late, because of trip before it and the other 4 hours were wasted on Biome Layers)
